/**
 * Creating a game:
 * - A game is created with a deck of cards (each card has 3 numbers (>=1) that added make 10).
 *   - Note: the 3 numbers represent magic, strength, intelligence
 * - When a game is created, its state is OPEN.
 *
 * Joining a game:
 * - A player can join an OPEN game (for simplicity, a player is indicated by its username).
 * - When 2 players join the game, the state of the game changes to PLAYING.
 * - A player can't join if the game state is not OPEN (throw an exception if someone tries).
 *
 * Picking cards:
 * - When the game is PLAYING, any player that joined the game can pick a card.
 * - TODO: Picking is only allowed when PLAYING
 * - After picking a card, a player must keep it or discard it, before picking another one.
 * - A player can only discard 2 cards (i.e. must pick 3 cards).
 *
 * The battle (point calculation):
 * - When the 2 players have picked 3 cards, the winner of that round is calculated:
 *   - Each player adds all magics, all strengths and all intelligences
 *   - Totals of each category is compared between players
 *   - Player who wins in 2 categories earns a point (there may be no winner)
 *
 * - After the points are calculated, a new battle starts (players pick cards again)
 * - If there are less than 10 cards in the deck, the game changes to state FINISHED
